<h1>Simulate and Control a 4-DOF Robot Arm with MATLAB and Simscape Multibody</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Robotics is defined practically as the study,
design and use of robot systems for
manufacturing and generally are used to
perform highly repetitive, unsafe, hazardous,
and unpleasant tasks. Robotics many different
functions that used either in industry and
manufacture or in complex, clatter and changing
environment such as pick and place, assembly,
drilling, welding, machine tool load and unload
functions, painting, spraying, etc. or in A
delivery in a hospital and Hotels, Discovering
the space As a results of these different tasks
there are different robot arm configuration such
as rectangular, spherical, cylindrical, revolute
and prismatic jointed.
A pick and place robot arm is used to ease
process of moving materials and supplying the
motion required in the manufacturing processes.
The transfer process of the materials is usually
being accomplished, using man power and as
the transfer process is repeated for a period of
time, it can cause injuries to the operator. the
robot arm preventing injuries and increasing the
efficiency of the work, with reducing the human
being errors that cost higly time and martial.</p>

<h2>DESIGN AND MODELLING OF 4 DOF ROBOTIC
ARM IN SOLID WORKS

</h2>
<section><p>The 3D CAD model of the robotic arm was designed using
Solid works 2016 software program as shown in Fig. 1.<br> The
3D geometrical model was exported from Solid Works and
imported into Matlab/Simulink environment.<br>
The SimMechanics was used to model mechanical systems
consisting of rigid bodies connected by joints that represent
translational and rotational degrees of freedom.<br>
SimMechanics automatically sets up a single absolute inertial
reference frame and coordinate system. <br>
The steps used
involved control of the robots motions by adding an additional port to the joints blocks. <br>The basic SimMechanics
block was completed by couplings, joints, sensors,
connections and further blocks for the inverse kinematic task.
The completed block is shown in Fig. 2</p>
