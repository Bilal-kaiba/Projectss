	<h1>Modeling and Control of 2-DOF Robot Arm</h1>
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<section>
		<P>Robotics is defined practically as the study,
design and use of robot systems for
manufacturing and generally are used to
perform highly repetitive, unsafe, hazardous,
and unpleasant tasks. Robotics many different
functions that used either in industry and
manufacture or in complex, clatter and changing
environment such as pick and place, assembly,
drilling, welding, machine tool load and unload
functions, painting, spraying, etc. or in A
delivery in a hospital and Hotels, Discovering
the space As a results of these different tasks
there are different robot arm configuration such
as rectangular, spherical, cylindrical, revolute
and prismatic jointed.
A pick and place robot arm is used to ease
process of moving materials and supplying the
motion required in the manufacturing processes.
The transfer process of the materials is usually
being accomplished, using man power and as
the transfer process is repeated for a period of
time, it can cause injuries to the operator. the
robot arm preventing injuries and increasing the
efficiency of the work, with reducing the human
being errors that cost higly time and martial.</P>
<h3>Robot Specification And Kinematics </h3>
<h4>Robot specification</h4>

<p>A two degree of freedom robot arm is described in Figure (1)</p><p>
	
	which consists primarily of two links with the
following specifications in OXY coordinates:<br>
ùêø1 = 1 m is the length of the first link.<br>
ùêø2 = 1 m is the length of the second link.<br>
ùëö1 = 1 kg is the mass of the first link.<br>
ùëö2 = 1 kg is the link of the second link.<br>
ùúÉ1 = the rotation angel of the first link.<br>
ùúÉ2 = is the rotation angel of the second link.<br>

		<h3>Robot Kinematics</h3>
		<h4>Forward Kinematics</h4>
		<p>The Forward kinematics of a robotic arm is
determined a group of parameters called
Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters which
used for deriving the homogenous
transformation matrices between the different
frames assigned on the robot arm structure. The
DH parameters for a two degree of freedom
robotic arm are defined as follows:</p>

    <h3>Inverse Kinematics</h3>
    <div>The inverse kinematics of a robotic arm is a
solution of finding the robot arm joint variables
of given the position Cartesian coordinates of
the end-effector. The mathematical equations
used to solve the inverse kinematics problem
can be derived either algebraically or
geometrically. The geometrical approach is
considered to be much easier for robot arms of
high degrees of freedom. In our Case, we solved
the inverse kinematics equations for the 2-DOF
robotic arm shown in Figure(2) using the
geometrical method</div>

<div>The dynamic model of a robot is concerned with
the movement and the forces involved in the
robot arm and establishes a mathematical
