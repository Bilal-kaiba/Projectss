<h1>Introduction</h1>
<section>
	<ul>
		<li>A crankshaft is a rotating that converts reciprocating motion of the pistons into rotational motion .A crankshaft connects with the piston through a connecting rod. The main objective of this connecting rod is to receive reciprocating motion by the piston and delivers it to the crankshaft.
</li>
		<li>They are used commonly in internal combustion engines</li>
		<li>Here, only a single cylinder piston is considered: 1 degree of freedom (DOF) system</li>


	</ul>
	<ol><p>Requirements for a crankshaft modeling </p>
		
<li>Ground, gravity and internal reference system

<li>Three bodies</li>
<li>Four joints </li>


	</ol>
	<p>The simulation is created on matlab with simscape,This tool is very powerful,we can import Cat model or we create it like in this exemple shown</p>

	<p><strong>Figure 1: Simulink model of 2DOF robor arm</strong><br>
	in this Figure(Figure1),there are three bodie with 4 joints; two of them are revolution,one is prismatic and the fourd is bearing joint</p><br>
	<section>
		<p>The model is simulated on Mechanics Explorers(matlab 2018)</p>
